	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

@inproceedings{Payton1996,
abstract = {The coefficient of variation (CV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, is often used in experimental situations. The exact distribution of the sample CV from a normally distributed population is complicated and obtaining a confidence interval for the population CV in this situation would require using the non-central t distribution and sequential techniques (Koopmans, et al., 1964). This paper explores the use of approximate distributions in determining confidence limits for the CV. The gamma distribution is used to model data appropriate for the calculation of the CV. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of four different intervals developed in this paper. A data set from a forestry experiment is analyzed using one of these techniques.},

@article{Kelley2007,
abstract = {The accuracy in parameter estimation approach to sample size planning is developed for the coefficient of variation, where the goal of the method is to obtain an accurate parameter estimate by achieving a sufficiently narrow confidence interval. The first method allows researchers to plan sample size so that the expected width of the confidence interval for the population coefficient of variation is sufficiently narrow. A modification allows a desired degree of assurance to be incorporated into the method, so that the obtained confidence interval will be sufficiently narrow with some specified probability (e.g., 85{\%} assurance that the 95 confidence interval width will be no wider than to units). Tables of necessary sample size are provided for a variety of scenarios that may help researchers planning a study where the coefficient of variation is of interest plan an appropriate sample size in order to have a sufficiently narrow confidence interval, optionally with somespecified assurance of the confidence interval being sufficiently narrow. Freely available computer routines have been developed that allow researchers to easily implement all of the methods discussed in the article.},

@article{Altunkaynak2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC In non-normal populations, it is more convenient to use the coefficient of quartile variation rather than the coefficient of variation. This study compares the percentile and t-bootstrap confidence intervals with Bonett's confidence interval for the quartile variation. We show that empirical coverage of the bootstrap confidence intervals is closer to the nominal coverage (0.95) for small sample sizes (n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 15) for most distributions studied. Bootstrap confidence intervals also have smaller average width. Thus, we propose using bootstrap confidence intervals for the coefficient of quartile variation when the sample size is small.},
